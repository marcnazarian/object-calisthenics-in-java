Object Calisthenics - coding dojo (by Jeff Bay)
===============================================

The challenge:
--------------
Do a simple project using far stricter coding standards than you’ve ever used in your life.
Below, you’ll find 9 “rules of thumb” that will help push your code into good object-oriented
shape.

The rules:
----------
    1. One level of indentation per method
    2. Don’t use the ELSE keyword
    3. Wrap all primitives and Strings
    4. First class collections
    5. One dot per line
    6. Don’t abbreviate
    7. Keep all entities small
    8. No classes with more than two instance variables
    9. No getters/setters/properties
